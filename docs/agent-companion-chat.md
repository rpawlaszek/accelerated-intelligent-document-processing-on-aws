## Security and Privacy

### Code Intelligence and Third-Party Services

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read Before Using Code Intelligence**

The Agent Companion Chat includes an optional Code Intelligence Agent that can provide enhanced code assistance and technical documentation. However, this agent uses third-party MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, which means your queries may be sent to external services.

**What This Means**:
- When Code Intelligence is **enabled**, queries routed to this agent may be sent to external services (DeepWiki MCP server)
- These external services are **not controlled by AWS** or your organization
- Data sent to these services is subject to their privacy policies and terms of service

**Security Best Practices**:

✅ **Safe to Discuss**:
- General IDP features and capabilities
- Public documentation and configuration examples
- Generic code patterns and best practices
- Non-sensitive technical questions
- Publicly available information

❌ **DO NOT Share**:
- Customer names, email addresses, or personal information
- AWS account IDs, API keys, credentials, or secrets
- Proprietary business logic or confidential data
- Internal system details or security configurations
- Actual document content or extracted data
- Customer-specific information or use cases
- Private network configurations or IP addresses

**Built-in Protections**:
- System prompts are configured to prevent the agent from sending sensitive data
- The agent is instructed to refuse requests involving credentials or personal information
- User-controlled toggle allows you to disable the feature entirely

**Recommendations**:
1. **Review your questions** before sending to ensure they contain no sensitive information
2. **Use other agents** (Analytics, Error Analyzer, General) for queries involving your actual system data
3. **Enable only when needed** for generic code help, then disable it again

### Data Storage and Retention

**Conversation History**:
- All conversations are stored in DynamoDB within your AWS account
- Conversation history is retained for the duration of your session
- Data remains within your AWS environment and is subject to your AWS security policies
- No conversation data is sent to external services except when Code Intelligence is enabled and invoked

**Session Isolation**:
- Each conversation has a unique session ID
- Sessions are isolated from each other
- Clearing chat creates a new session
- Previous session data is not accessible from new sessions

## Architecture Overview

### System Design

The Agent Companion Chat uses a session-based architecture that differs fundamentally from the job-based document troubleshooting system:

```mermaid

    User[User] -->|Types Message| UI[Chat Interface]
    UI -->|GraphQL Mutation| Backend[Backend Services]
    Backend -->|Store Message| DB[(Message Storage)]
    Backend -->|Load History| Memory[(Conversation Memory)]
    Backend -->|Route Query| Orchestrator[Orchestrator Agent]

    General -->|Stream Response| Backend
    
    Backend -->|Real-time Updates| UI
    UI -->|Display| User
    Backend -->|Save Turn| Memory
```

### Key Architectural Components

**1. Session-Based Conversations**

Unlike the job-based troubleshooting system (one request → one response), the companion chat maintains persistent sessions:

| Component | Document Troubleshooting | Agent Companion Chat |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Interaction Model** | Single-shot analysis | Multi-turn conversation |
| **Context** | Document-specific | Session-based with history |
| **Memory** | Stateless | Persistent (last 20 turns) |
| **Agents** | Error Analyzer only | Multiple specialized agents |
| **Lambda Functions** | `agent_processor`, `agent_request_handler` | `agent_chat_processor`, `agent_chat_resolver` |
| **Storage** | Job results only | Full conversation history |

**2. Conversation Memory System**

The chat maintains conversation history in DynamoDB:
- **Automatic Loading**: Last 20 conversation turns loaded on each request
- **Context Management**: Sliding window keeps conversations within token limits
- **Turn Grouping**: Each turn contains one user message and one assistant response
- **Smart Optimization**: Drops verbose tool results while preserving user-visible content

**3. Real-Time Streaming**

Messages stream in real-time using AWS AppSync GraphQL subscriptions:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI
    participant Backend
    participant Agent
    
    User->>UI: Send message
    UI->>Backend: GraphQL mutation
    Backend->>Backend: Store message
    Backend-->>UI: Acknowledge (immediate)
    
    UI->>Backend: Subscribe to updates
    
    Backend->>Agent: Process with history
    
    loop Streaming Response
        Agent->>Backend: Generate chunk
        Backend->>UI: Publish chunk
        UI->>User: Display chunk
    end
    
    Agent->>Backend: Complete response
    Backend->>UI: Final message
    Backend->>Backend: Save to memory
```

**Benefits of Streaming**:
- Users see responses immediately as they're generated
- No waiting for complete response before seeing anything
- Transparent view of agent thinking process
- Better user experience for long responses

**4. Intelligent Agent Orchestration**

The orchestrator agent acts as a smart router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Query[User Query] --> Orchestrator[Orchestrator Agent]
    Orchestrator --> Analyze{Analyze Intent}
    
    Analyze -->|"Data/metrics query"| Analytics[Analytics Agent]
    Analyze -->|"Error/troubleshooting"| ErrorAnalyzer[Error Analyzer]
    Analyze -->|"Code/technical docs"| CodeIntel[Code Intelligence]
    Analyze -->|"General question"| General[General Agent]
    
    Analytics --> Response[Synthesized Response]
    ErrorAnalyzer --> Response
    CodeIntel --> Response
    General --> Response
    
    Response --> User[User]
```

**Orchestrator Capabilities**:
- Analyzes query intent to select the right specialist
- Can coordinate multiple agents for complex queries
- Prevents redundant calls to the same agent
- Streams sub-agent execution in real-time
- Detects and visualizes structured data

**5. Sub-Agent Streaming**

When the orchestrator calls a specialized agent, you see the execution in real-time:

```
🔧 Calling: Error Analyzer Agent
   ↓
   [Streaming output...]
   "Searching CloudWatch logs for validation errors..."
   "Found 8 matching errors in the last hour..."
   "Analyzing error patterns..."
   ↓
   ✓ Complete: Analysis finished
```

This transparency helps you understand:
- Which tools the agent is using
- What data it's accessing
- How it's reasoning about your query
- Why it reached its conclusions

### Data Flow

**Message Lifecycle**:

1. **User Input** → Message typed in chat interface
2. **Storage** → Message stored in ChatMessagesTable with session ID
3. **History Loading** → Last 20 turns loaded from ChatMemoryTable
4. **Agent Processing** → Orchestrator routes to appropriate specialist
5. **Streaming** → Response chunks published via AppSync subscription
6. **Display** → UI renders chunks progressively
7. **Memory Save** → Complete turn saved to ChatMemoryTable
8. **Final Storage** → Complete response stored in ChatMessagesTable

**Session Management**:
- Each conversation has a unique session ID (UUID v4)
- Sessions isolate conversations from each other
- Conversation history persists within a session
- Clearing chat creates a new session ID

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Chat

1. Navigate to the **Agent Chat** section in the Web UI navigation
2. The chat interface opens with a welcome message and sample prompts
3. Start typing your question or click a sample prompt to begin

### Your First Conversation

The chat interface provides sample prompts to help you get started:

**Analytics Questions**:
- "How many documents were processed today?"
- "Show me the success rate for the last week"
- "What are the most common document types?"

**Error Analysis**:
- "Show me recent processing errors"
- "What validation errors occurred today?"
- "Why did document lending_package.pdf fail?"

**System Help**:
- "How does the classification stage work?"
- "What models are supported for extraction?"
- "Explain the assessment process"

**Code Assistance** (if Code Intelligence is enabled):
- "How do I implement a custom extraction prompt?"
- "Show me an example of custom validation logic"
- "What's the best way to handle multi-page documents?"


## Core Features

### Multi-Turn Conversations with Memory

The companion chat remembers your conversation history, enabling natural follow-up questions:

**Example Conversation**:
```
You: "How many documents failed today?"
Agent: "I found 15 failed documents today. The most common error was 
       ValidationException affecting 8 documents..."

You: "What caused those validation errors?"
Agent: "Based on the 8 validation errors I mentioned, the primary cause 
       was malformed JSON in extraction prompts..."

You: "How can I fix that?"
Agent: "To fix the validation errors, you should update your extraction 
       configuration..."
```

The agent maintains context throughout the conversation, so you don't need to repeat information.

### Real-Time Streaming Responses

Watch responses appear progressively as the agent generates them:

- **Live Text**: See the response being written word-by-word
- **Streaming Indicators**: Visual feedback shows when the agent is actively thinking
- **Sub-Agent Visibility**: Expandable sections show when specialized agents are called
- **Structured Data**: Charts and tables render automatically when detected

### Intelligent Agent Routing

The orchestrator automatically routes your query to the right specialist:

**How It Works**:
1. You ask a question
2. The orchestrator analyzes your query
3. It routes to the appropriate specialized agent (Analytics, Error Analyzer, Code Intelligence, or General)
4. You see which agent is being used in real-time
5. The agent responds with specialized knowledge

**Multi-Agent Coordination**:
For complex queries, the orchestrator can consult multiple agents:

```
You: "Show me today's failed documents and explain the most common error"

Agent: [Calls Analytics Agent] → Retrieves failed document list
       [Calls Error Analyzer] → Analyzes error patterns
       [Synthesizes Response] → Provides comprehensive answer
```


### Structured Data Visualization

The chat automatically detects and visualizes structured data in responses:

**📊 Charts and Plots**:
When the agent provides data suitable for visualization, it automatically renders as an interactive chart:

```
You: "Show me document processing trends for the last 7 days"

Agent: [Displays line chart showing daily processing volumes]
       "Here's the processing trend over the last week. You can see 
       a spike on Tuesday with 245 documents..."
```

**📋 Tables**:
Tabular data is rendered with sorting and filtering capabilities:

```
You: "List the failed documents from today"

Agent: [Displays sortable table]
       | Document Name | Error Type | Timestamp |
       |---------------|------------|-----------|
       | contract.pdf  | Validation | 14:23:45  |
       | form_123.pdf  | Timeout    | 15:30:12  |
```

**📝 Formatted Code**:
Code examples include syntax highlighting:

```
You: "Show me an example extraction prompt"

Agent: [Displays formatted JSON with syntax highlighting]
       {
         "extraction": {
           "model": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
           "attributes": [...]
         }
       }
```

### Tool Usage Transparency

See exactly what the agent is doing behind the scenes:

**Expandable Tool Sections**:
- Click to expand and see tool execution details
- View inputs sent to tools
- See outputs returned from tools
- Understand the agent's reasoning process

**Sub-Agent Calls**:
When the orchestrator calls a specialized agent, you see:
- Which sub-agent is being invoked
- Real-time streaming output from the sub-agent
- Final results from the sub-agent
- Any errors encountered

**Example**:
```
🔧 Using Tool: Error Analyzer
   Input: "Analyze recent validation errors"
   
   [Streaming output from Error Analyzer...]
   "Searching CloudWatch logs..."
   "Found 8 validation errors..."
   "Analyzing error patterns..."
   
   ✓ Complete: Root cause identified
```

### Best Practices

**Asking Effective Questions**:

✅ **Good Questions**:
```
"Show me documents that failed with validation errors today"
"How do I configure the extraction model?"
"What's the average processing time for invoices?"
```

❌ **Less Effective**:
```
"Help" (too vague)
"Errors" (not specific enough)
"Fix it" (no context)
```

**Using Follow-Up Questions**:

Take advantage of conversation memory:
```
You: "How many documents failed today?"
Agent: "15 documents failed today..."

You: "Show me the first 5"  ← Agent remembers context
Agent: "Here are the first 5 failed documents..."

You: "What caused the first one?"  ← Still in context
Agent: "The first document failed because..."
```

**When to Start a New Conversation**:

Start a new chat session when:
- Switching to a completely different topic
- The conversation becomes too long or unfocused
- You want to test the same query without prior context
- You've resolved an issue and want a fresh start


## Common Use Cases
